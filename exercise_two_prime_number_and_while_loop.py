    Write a function while_loop(number). The variable
    number is a string.

    *If the character in the string is a number, the function
      returns the sum of all integer numbers between 1 and
      number inclusive. Please refer to the sample output
      below:
      Example1:
            while_loop("3")
            Output: 6
            Explanation: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

    *If the character in the string is not a number, (or not an integer
      number) the function returns the string "Error". Please refer to the
      sample output below:
      Example2:
            while_loop("Hello")
            Output: "Error"
            Explanation: Chracters in the string are not numbers.
            Hint: You may want to consider using a try statement with an except statement.

    *If the character in the sting is a number less than one, the function
      returns the number zero as a default. Please refer to the sample
      output below:
      Example3:
            while_loop("-1")
            Output: 0
            Explanation: The number in the string is less than one. The defaul of zero is returned.
